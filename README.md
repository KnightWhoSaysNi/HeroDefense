# Hero Defense 

A tower defense-like game, where enemies spawn, run through the level and try to reach some end point and thus make the player lose the game. The difference is that the player has a first person view of the environment and can move around and place various traps and use spells instead of the regular bird eye view and tower placement. The main inspiration is a game Orcs Must Die, by Robot Entertainment.
